                This is JULIA CHILD.
                Back in the public eye after the success of recent film Julie & Julia, our love affair with the spunky cookbook author and television chef continues. Inspired by French cuisine while living in Paris, she became one of few women to graduate from the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu cooking school. She then penned her famous 800-page book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, to show Americans how to cook sophisticated fare step-by-step. Her celebrity skyrocketed as a television chef and her original 14x20 foot kitchen is on permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian.

            <h3>Chocolate Cake</h3>
            <p>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely.</p>

            <p>The Food is Always Delicious!” We like to go to The Fairway every time we come to the Cape. The food is always delicious! This is the first year we could make reservations (probably due to spacing because of the virus). Our waitress, Casey, was great!</p>
